## The future of Codiad...

I absolutely love Codiad, probably one of the best projects I've worked on, and the community that got involved and kept it alive has been amazing. It was a hobby project for me that I saw turn into something bigger than I ever would have expected.

That being said, I consider the platform to be outdated. The biggest issue for me personally is the lack of testing and DOM-manip nature of jQuery vs. a modern reactive SPA framework. The architecture works at the level where Codiad resides but extending the features and functionality of the app would be a stretch and regressions would become hard to mitigate, so I generally feel, from an architectural standpoint, its future is limited.

As mentioned; it is MIT licensed, so I welcome public forks and any additional code against the application, but I presume maintenance by folks on the "core" will continue to dwindle.

## For anyone looking for alternatives...

If anyone is interested, I would highly suggest [c9/core](https://github.com/c9/core), the public repo is easy to stand up, and I run it similarly to how I ran Codiad; on a DigitalOcean Droplet with fairly minimal resources.

I've maintained a strong interest in web-based editors, and [CodeAnywhere](https://codeanywhere.com), [ShiftEdit](https://shiftedit.com), [Theia](https://github.com/theia-ide/theia), [CodeTasty](https://codetasty.com/) all feel to me like they try to approach things in a similar manner to Codiad - more editor than IDE.

Eclipse Che (project that runs [Koding](https://koding.com) platform) is a much larger option for those looking for a lot more tooling and IDE-like features.
