I've found myself roaming in the backend more and more recently, and honestly it worries me. While I am not an expert on PHP, Backends, or Security; I have spent hours reading about them, and have a fair amount of expeirence implementing them. Sadly, Atheos doesn't use JWTs, at least as far as I've been able to understand. Atheos also URIEncodes a ton of information and send it it plaintext to the server in the URL. Weirder still is that it does post things all the time as well, and stranger than that, it will plain text a path to the server, and, in handling the response, use the path the server replied with, but the server didn't do anything to the path. The client often times passes variables to the server for the server to pass them back to the client to be handled all within the exact same function. Talk about bizarre.
