I've reached a point where only the most critical files remain untouched, and I actually made it though one of the larger ones. Sadly, I think it's already getting really close to having to fully cut ties with Codiad. What I mean is that I've rewrote so much of the code, that maintaining compatability with Codiad plugins is really starting to cause a huge headache.

I think the next release will be when I remove a ton of my compatabilty checks, but I also have an idea to create a compatability plugin to bridge the gap. Yeah that might be the best solution.
