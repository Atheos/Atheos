I'm starting to really grasp the volume of work ahead of me in regards to refactoring Atheos. There were a lot of people who worked on the OG Codiad over many years. The deeper I get into the core files, the more I see discrepencies, and a lot of duct tape honestly. I'm reaching a point where the only way forward is to completely move away from supporting older plugins. There are simpy put too many different ways to accomplish all of the things Atheos does built into it, and trying to unify all of them cohesievly means removing functions and namespaces that plugins use. The settings component is one I'm hitting now where to really simply if it's functions for future use, I have to nearly rewrite the entire thing, which means older plugins won't be able to have settings.
