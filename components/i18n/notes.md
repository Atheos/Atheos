Thoughts on settings:
The Forces Language could be specified as a global constant in the config file. If unspecified, then it's user choice. Give Admins more control.

It needs be able to return an array, json data, so the cache is really not helpful. Honestly, the current setup for i18n is closer to what I need, but it's not easy to follow development wise, and this one is.


Needs to return the key if not translation found.
