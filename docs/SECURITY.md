## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please send an email to info@atheos.io in order to report any security issues you find that and think shouldn't be shared publically. If you feel that opening an issue in the repo is appropriate, please feel free to do so. The Atheos team will get back to you as soon as we can.

The security and safety of Atheos users is our highest priority, however if you feel that we haven't responded in a timely fashion, we encourage you to reach out to us and express your concerns. Additionally, should you for any reason feel that we have failed to satisfy your concerns, please feel free to publically release your insight as we would rather our community know than not know.
