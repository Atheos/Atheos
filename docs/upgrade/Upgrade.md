To upgrade simply delete everything except the following or move these folders to a new directory:

    /config.php
    /data
    /workspace
    /plugins
    /themes
    
Navigate to ```/themes``` and delete the ```default``` folder. Download the neweset verson from codiad.com and extract its content to the root directory of your Codiad installation.
