			<h3>Atheos Web IDE</h3>

			<p>Atheos is a web-based IDE framework with a small footprint and minimal requirements, built on top of Codiad by FluidByte</p>

			<p>Keep up to date with the latest changes and news on <strong><a href="https://github.com/HLSiira/Atheos">Github</a></strong></p>

			<h3>Features</h3>

			<p>Atheos was built with simplicity in mind, allowing for fast, interactive development without the massive overhead of some of the larger desktop editors. That being said even users of IDE's
				such as Eclipse, NetBeans and Aptana are finding Atheos's simplicity to be a huge benefit. While simplicity was key, we didn't skimp on features and have a team of dedicated developer actively adding more.

				<li>Plugin Library & Marketplace</li>

				<li>Editor screen splitting</li>
				<li>LocalStorage redundancy</li>
				<li>Advanced searching tools</li>
				<li>Smart auto-complete</li>
			</ul>

			<ul class="features_right">
				<li>Real-Time Collaborative editing</li>
				<li>20+ Syntax color themes</li>
				<li>Completely Open-Source</li>
				<li>Easily customized source</li>

			<p>...and with a team of passionate collaborators the list keeps growing.</p>

			<h3>Interface</h3>

			<p>Atheos consists of three panels; a left panel which houses the file manager and active files, center panel which is where editors reside, and a right panel which contains system and other controls. The right &amp; left side panels collapse providing maximum real-estate to the editor.</p>

			<h3>Requirements</h3>

			<p>Atheos requires a minimal server installation with Apache2, PHP 5+ and basic r/w access to several directories. There is no database requirement</p>

			<p>The application will work in modern browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and IE9+, though it is developed in Chrome</p>

			<h3>Getting Started</h3>

			<p>Installation of Atheos requires uploading the files and making several directories and a config file writeable. There is no database and no other server components are required. PHP 5.3 or above is recommended, however, the system will work with any version of PHP over v.5.</p>

			<p>For more information please <strong><a href="https://github.com/HLSiira/Atheos/wiki/Installation">read the installation instructions</a></strong> on the Wiki.</p>
