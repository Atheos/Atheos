## Notes, by Liam Siira

Looking though the javascript, I see a lot of triggers for h-size-init within the sidebars.js module. I originally thought it was a method for triggering a resize event, but removing it sometimes doesn't seem to have any affect and a quick google search with zero effort turned up nothing. Need to figure out what these are four, but for now, they are staying.
