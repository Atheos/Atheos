``format_time``
===============

.. versionadded:: 2.12
    The ``format_time`` filter was added in Twig 2.12.

The ``format_time`` filter formats a time. It behaves in the exact same way as
the ``format_datetime`` filter, but without the date.

.. note::

    The ``format_time`` filter is part of the ``IntlExtension`` which is not
    installed by default. Install it first:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ composer req twig/intl-extra

    Then, use the ``twig/extra-bundle`` on Symfony projects or add the extension
    explicitly on the Twig environment::

        use Twig\Extra\Intl\IntlExtension;

        $twig = new \Twig\Environment(...);
        $twig->addExtension(new IntlExtension());

Arguments
---------

* ``locale``: The locale
* ``timeFormat``: The time format
* ``pattern``: A date time pattern
