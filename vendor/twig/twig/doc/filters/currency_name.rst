``currency_name``
=================

.. versionadded:: 2.12
    The ``currency_name`` filter was added in Twig 2.12.

The ``currency_name`` filter returns the currency name given its three-letter
code:

.. code-block:: twig

    {# Euro #}
    {{ 'EUR'|currency_name }}

    {# Japanese Yen #}
    {{ 'JPY'|currency_name }}

By default, the filter uses the current locale. You can pass it explicitly:

.. code-block:: twig

    {# yen japonais #}
    {{ 'JPY'|currency_name('fr_FR') }}

.. note::

    The ``currency_name`` filter is part of the ``IntlExtension`` which is not
    installed by default. Install it first:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ composer req twig/intl-extra

    Then, use the ``twig/extra-bundle`` on Symfony projects or add the extension
    explicitly on the Twig environment::

        use Twig\Extra\Intl\IntlExtension;

        $twig = new \Twig\Environment(...);
        $twig->addExtension(new IntlExtension());

Arguments

* ``locale``: The locale
